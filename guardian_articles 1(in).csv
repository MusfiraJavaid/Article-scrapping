Self-belief and sex eggs: 10 things we learned about Gwyneth Paltrow from an explosive new biography,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jul/30/10-things-we-learned-gwyneth-paltrow-new-biography-amy-odell,"When the author Amy Odell approached Gwyneth Paltrow’s publicist about her plans for a biography of the actor, Goop founder and wellness pioneer, she was told that Paltrow would be glad to participate – if she was allowed to “factcheck” the book. Odell didn’t agree. Her line to Paltrow eventually fell silent, and her book,Gwyneth, has just been published to much buzz, without the star’s participation. Paltrow, a source claimed to Odell, “inventedghosting”. Now, post-publication, you can picture dozens more being cast out of her golden glow. Odell spoke to more than 220 people for her book, on and off the record; more rebuffed her. “Many were terrified to talk about Gwyneth,” she writes.",2025-07-30T15:14:18.000Z
‘Everybody was fondling underwater!’: the Rocky Horror Picture Show at 50 – an oral history,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jul/31/the-rocky-horror-picture-show-at-50-an-oral-history,"The Rocky Horror Picture Show was released in cinemas in late 1975 with little fanfare, but the provocative musical, with its campy parody of sci-fi and horror B-movies, fabulous costumes and rollicking songs, dug its glittering heels in and refused to let go for the next 50 years. The film was an adaptation of the hit musical The Rocky Horror Show, created byRichard O’Brienwhen he was an unemployed actor. The story of Dr Frank-N-Furter (Tim Curry), an alien, transvestite scientist, decked out like a bewitching glam rock god and hellbent on seducing everyone around him, galvanised audiences into participating in a waythat had never been seen before. As its popularity grew, audiences began to take an active role in screenings – dressing up, dancing, singing along and adding their own lines of dialogue. Screenings also became safe spaces for LGBTQ+ fans, drawn to the film’s unabashed celebration of queerness, sexual liberation and gender fluidity.",2025-07-31T04:00:38.000Z
This trade deal is the EU’s Suez moment – its subservience to Trump is on show for all to see,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/31/this-trade-deal-is-the-eus-suez-moment-its-subservience-to-trump-is-on-show-for-all-to-see,"The Suez crisis in 1956 was a humiliating moment of truth for the UK. Faced with implacable opposition from the US, Anthony Eden’s government was forced to abandon military action in Egypt. Capitulation to American pressure was a recognition of Britain’s diminished status on the world stage. The trade deal agreed between Washington and Brussels this week lacks the drama of troops being sent in to recapture one of the world’s key waterways, but it is the EU’s Suez moment all the same. What’s more, European politicians know as much. Donald Trump said the outcome was “great”, and for the US that was certainly the case, since the EUmade all the concessionsand got nothing in return. Most European goods exported to the US will face a 15% tariff, while the already small tariffs on US goods entering the EU will be eliminated altogether. European companies have been forced to accept higher costs as the price of access to the world’s biggest market.",2025-07-31T07:00:41.000Z
Don’t call it morning sickness: ‘At times in my pregnancy I wondered if this was death coming for me’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/31/dont-call-it-morning-sickness-hyperemesis-gravidarum-extreme-pregnancy,"The year my body revolted, I read all 1,296 pages of War and Peace. I did very little else. My body had become stuck in a perpetual rinse cycle, wringing itself out day and night. Becalmed on the sofa, too nauseated to mindlessly scroll, I found an unlikely emergency exit in the bloody Battle of Borodino. In between puking jags, I would prop the book open on my chest, squint at the tiny text, and drift into a Tolstoy-induced torpor. It occurred to me that clouds of saltpetre and the booming of cannon weren’t ideal conditions for a growing baby, but I had to go somewhere. At 6am my husband left for work and I began another gruelling day on the front; purging viscous pond slime from my empty stomach and keeping up with the Cossacks on their flanking march. In the throes of extreme pregnancy sickness, I found strange comfort in the privations of 19th-century military life; in soaked bandages and musket fire and impromptu field hospital amputations. And even, or especially, in the seeming endlessness of the book itself. For the months that I starved, I lugged my starving Russian comrades with me, from the upholstery-chemical stink of the sofa to the sweet bleach-stink of the bathroom to the seamy oily-skin stink of the bed. Perhaps it was a derangement of dehydration and hormones, but I felt real solidarity with my gangrenous friends on the front – far more than with anyone in a “felt cute” sundress on the What to Expect When You’re Expecting app. When the hyperemesis gravidarum began, throwing up 10 to 20 times a day had some degree of novelty. I was thrilled to be pregnant – only five weeks along and high on the discovery – and resolved to pay the price for the construction work my body was doing. “I am creating a whole central nervous system,” I thought, slumped and sweaty on the bathroom floor. But by the time we were on to fingernails and toenails, the adrenaline of the sprint had ebbed away. In the wake of what I imagined to be my martyred maternal heroics was panic. I suspected there were months of relentless nausea and puking still to come.",2025-07-31T04:00:39.000Z
We are witnessing the silencing of American media,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/30/trump-silencing-of-american-media,"The latest casualty ofDonald Trump’sefforts to silence media criticism is Eduardo Porter, one of the most thoughtful and intelligent critics of his heinous regime. On Tuesday, Porter wrote his last column for theWashington Post. In a widely circulated email, he explained why he was leaving the Post: Jeff Bezos and his new head of Opinion are taking the paper down a path I cannot follow, directed toward the relentless promotion of free markets and personal liberties … I have no idea to what extent this is driven by Mr Bezos’ fear of what Donald Trump could do to his various business interests, most of which are more valuable to him than The Post.”",2025-07-30T12:00:02.000Z
Colorado dentist convicted of murder after poisoning wife’s protein shakes,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/30/colorado-dentist-murder-protein-shakes,"A jury convicted aColoradodentist of first-degree murder on Wednesday after he repeatedly poisoned his wife, including by lacing her protein shakes. Prosecutors had accused James Craig of repeatedly poisoning his wife, Angela Craig, over 10 days in March 2023. When those attempts failed, prosecutors said the dentist gave his wife a final dose of cyanide as she was hospitalized in suburban Denver with symptoms that puzzled doctors. She was declared brain dead soon after. Craig stood in a hushed courtroom on Wednesday afternoon as the jury delivered a litany of guilty verdicts on murder and other charges. Afterward, he sat down and his attorneys rested their hands on his shoulder. They whispered to each other while awaiting sentencing.",2025-07-30T21:49:53.000Z
"Sweat, stingers and scratching: 14 expert, easy ways to treat and prevent insect bites",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/31/sweat-stingers-and-scratching-14-expert-easy-ways-to-treat-and-prevent-insect-bites,"Adownside to hot weather is all the bugs that can feast on or sting us. Is there anything you can do to avoid this? And what should you do if you are attacked? Here’s what pharmacists have to say about the best ways to prevent and treat stings and bites. The British Pest Control Association has warned of arise in wasp activitydue to recent heatwaves. “I am definitely seeing more wasps around at the moment,” says Claire Nevinson, the superintendent pharmacist for Boots UK. “We have seen an increase in people presenting with infected insect bites since April.” “It is a bit of a shock when you are stung by a wasp,” says Ian Budd, an independent prescribing pharmacist forChemist4U. “It is painful and, if you’re unlucky, it can trigger an allergic reaction. Hornets and bees are less aggressive. Horsefly bites can cause inflammation and sometimes infection, because it is difficult to stop scratching them. Then there are midges, and we do have mosquitoes in the UK, not the kind that carry malaria but they can still cause issues. And we have ticks, in grassy and wooded areas, some of which carry Lyme disease.”",2025-07-31T09:00:44.000Z
"Critics say Starmer is no Attlee – and they’re right. Labour must look to the future, not the past",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/31/starmer-no-attlee-labour-future-not-past-labour-leaders-in-shadow,"We raised a glass last Saturday evening, the four of us, to toast the 80th anniversary of the 1945Labourgovernment. None was old enough to remember the event itself, but three of us were born while Clem Attlee was prime minister. In a funny way, I still take a kind of childish pride from that inheritance, as if a piece of that distant era somehow transferred itself by osmosis into my DNA. A photograph of Attlee in old age, taken and given to me by the late Sally Soames, is a treasured possession too. Our little group was certainly not alone this summer in marking Attlee’s anniversary. There have been TV documentaries and, most substantially, David Runciman’s fascinating Postwar series on BBC Radio 4. All of these start – and Runciman’s series also ends – with the same enduringly astounding fact about Britain in 1945. Weeks after Winston Churchill had led the country to victory inthe war in Europe, the voters rejected him by a landslide in favour of Attlee’s Labour. Yet Labour’s triumph was led by the least triumphalist or bombastic of men. Eighty years ago, on 26 July 1945, the Daily Mail, bullying and wrong as always, warned Labour to accept its expected defeat “like men, and not like spoilt children”. That evening, driven there by his wife in the family car, Attlee went to Buckingham Palace to become prime minister. Peter Hennessy records that Attlee’s audience with the equally self-effacing George VI began with a long silence. Eventually, Attlee broke it by announcing: “I’ve won the election.” To which the king replied: “I know. I heard it on the six o’clock news.”",2025-07-31T05:00:39.000Z
‘There are times I feel I hate them’: how siblings can clash over end-of-life care for elderly parents,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/30/there-are-times-i-feel-i-hate-them-how-siblings-can-clash-over-end-of-life-care-for-elderly-parents,"When Anna’s* parents came to visit last year, she was determined to give them a relaxing holiday in her Queensland beach town. She’d been worried about them – her mum had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease and her dad had been having frequent falls. For years she’d been trying to get them to talk about whether they needed to move to aged care, to assess their financial situation and face what was coming next, but they’d dismissed her, saying they were fine. On the first day of their visit, Anna’s dad fell and broke his leg, badly. “He went into hospital and Mum came and stayed with me. I realised what they’d been covering up. Mum was so confused she was walking around the house without any pants on, which was confronting for my teenage boys. She didn’t know what day it was and she couldn’t read a clock. Then the hospital told me Dad was withdrawing from alcohol and had some dementia.” Anna moved her parents to a nearby aged care centre while her sister packed up the family home. The sisters had always had some issues in their relationship but the stress of seeing their parents so vulnerable, of selling the house and working through the financial situation, led to harsh words and hurtful accusations. Anna’s sister told their parents they were arguing. “They were distraught. It was awful. I had to set some boundaries, and I just stopped all communication.”",2025-07-30T15:00:33.000Z
President Lula hits back as Trump tariffs threaten US-Brazil trade showdown,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/30/us-brazil-lula-trump-tariffs,"Brazil’s president,Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has said he does not fear getting on the wrong side ofDonald Trump, as South America’s largest economy braces for the introduction of 50% tariffs. Trump announced plans to slapBrazilwith tariffs on 1 August earlier this month, partly in retaliation for a supposed political “witch-hunt” against his far-right allyJair Bolsonaro. The former Brazilian president faces decades in jail for allegedly plotting a military coup to stop Lula from taking office after the former lost the 2022 presidential election. On Wednesday, Trump signed an executive order confirming that the US would impose 50% tariffs onBrazil. The order did not mention the previously-cited 1 August deadline, but indicated that the new duty would be enforced from next week.",2025-07-30T15:27:47.000Z
