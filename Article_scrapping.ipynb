The film was an adaptation of the hit musical The Rocky Horror Show, created byRichard O\\u2019Brienwhen he was an unemployed actor. The story of Dr Frank-N-Furter (Tim Curry), an alien, transvestite scientist, decked out like a bewitching glam rock god and hellbent on seducing everyone around him, galvanised audiences into participating in a waythat had never been seen before. As its popularity grew, audiences began to take an active role in screenings \\u2013 dressing up, dancing, singing along and adding their own lines of dialogue. Screenings also became safe spaces for LGBTQ+ fans, drawn to the film\\u2019s unabashed celebration of queerness, sexual liberation and gender fluidity.\",\n          \"A jury convicted aColoradodentist of first-degree murder on Wednesday after he repeatedly poisoned his wife, including by lacing her protein shakes. Prosecutors had accused James Craig of repeatedly poisoning his wife, Angela Craig, over 10 days in March 2023. When those attempts failed, prosecutors said the dentist gave his wife a final dose of cyanide as she was hospitalized in suburban Denver with symptoms that puzzled doctors. She was declared brain dead soon after. Craig stood in a hushed courtroom on Wednesday afternoon as the jury delivered a litany of guilty verdicts on murder and other charges. Afterward, he sat down and his attorneys rested their hands on his shoulder.
